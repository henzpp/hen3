    <h1>CHATEAU DE VERSAILLES</h1>
    <p>The Palace of Versailles has been listed as a World Heritage Site for 40 years and is one of the greatest achievements in French 17th century art. Louis XIII's old hunting pavilion was transformed and extended by his son, Louis XIV, when he installed the Court and government there in 1682. A succession of kings continued to embellish the Palace up until the French Revolution.</p>
    <p>Today the Palace contains 2,300 rooms spread over 63,154 m2.</p>
